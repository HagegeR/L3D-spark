# WebSocket Streaming

For streaming graphics from Javascript running in a web browser

## Setup

1. Run `make bin/js-streaming.bin`
2. Flash __bin/js-streaming.bin__ to your cube.
3. Note your core's name and obtain an [access token](http://docs.spark.io/api/#authentication-generate-a-new-access-token) for use with the API.
4. Open __html/js-streaming/demo.html__ in your WebSocket-enabled browser.
5. Make sure that your cube is breathing cyan (connected to WiFi).
6. Enter your cube's name and paste in the access token.
7. Click the connect button on the demo web page.

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure the cube and the web browser are on the same local network.
